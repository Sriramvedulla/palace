	     between 1857 and 1869.</P>
    
      <p>
	     The palace is unique for its style and elegance. Construction of the palace began in the late 18th century and over
		 the decades a synthesis of many architectural styles and influences emerged. The palace consists of two courtyards
		 as well as the grand Khilwat (the Darbar Hall), fountains and gardens. The palace originally covered 45 acres (180,000 m2),
		 but only 12 acres (49,000 m2) remain today.</p>

	     Conservation works were initiated in Chowmahalla Palace from 2000, several conservation architects and experts were 
		 involved in more than a decade long journey. The initiative was undertaken by Princess Esra Birgen. Before commencement 
		 of the works, the place fell in disuse for a prolonged period and deteriorated over the time. Vision for the restoration 
		 project was to rescue the exemplary palatial complex and to establish a contemporary civic use as a museum showcasing the 
		 splendour and valour of Nizams.</p>
